# Image Stitcher Planning

This image stitcher should primarily be used to stitch chat messages. I'm not quite sure what other use it may have, but it should completely excel with chats. It should be compatible with both PC and mobile, along with providing quality-of-life features (this is a quality-of-life project after all).

## UI

The UI should be quite simplistic in terms of content. It should be in a vertical format, probably taking up about 600 to 800 pixels of horizontal space. It should make file uploading as easy as possible (including pasting, dragging, and plain uploading). It should automatically figure out the order of the images.
